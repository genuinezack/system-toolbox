# Zack's ZSH Plugins

This plugin is a collection of Zack's most commonly needed terminal lifehacks, wrapped up as a ZSH plugin.

To start using it, add the `zack` plugin to your `plugins` array in `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
plugins=(... zack)
```

To make the most of this plugin, you should be on Mac OS and have the github `hub` command installed.
